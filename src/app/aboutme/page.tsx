                I&lsquo;m a lifelong learner and adventurer with professional
                experience in web development. I like development because of the
                satisfaction I have in overcoming challenges. I&lsquo;m
                motivated by the opportunity software offers to positively
                impact an individual&lsquo;s life and the world as a whole.
